# 👋 Hey there, I'm Harshil Mistry!

Welcome to my little part of the internet 🌍— where backend is home, frontend is a work in progress, and debugging is part of the daily routine.

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 2nd-year BTech CSE student  
💻 Full-stack web developer (backend-leaning, but frontend is slowly making peace with me)   
🧠 Always learning — DSA, React, Django, ML, LLMs, AI Agents  
💡 Hackathon nerd. Workshops? Count me in.  

I make attempts to create cool stuff that solves real problems
